				<h3>What is a Database?</h3>
				<p>A database is a collection of related data. Most often when we speak of a database, 
				we refer to an electronic database. An electronic database is a database that runs on a computer or a server. 
				For the tutorials on this website, we will mainly focus on electronic databases precisely - relational databases. 
				A database can also refer to a non-electronics database. For example, a phone-book, library card catalog, a dictionary, etc..
				</p>
				<h3>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h3>
				<p>A database management system is a system software used for creating and maintaining the structure of a database. It
				is used to input, manipulate, and retrieve data.
				</p>
				<h4>Types of Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Hierarchical Database Management Systems</b> - organized like a tree like structure. Often used in large institution such as banks
						and insurance companies.</li>
						<li><b>Network Database Management Systems</b> - use a network structure to create relationships between entities. Often used on larger digital computers.</li>
						<li><b>Relational Database Management Systems</b> - is a system used for managing relational databases. </li>
						<li><b> Object-oriented Database Management Systems</b> - supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. </li>
					</ul>
					<em><b>Note: </b> On this website, our primary focus is Relational Database Management Systems.</em>
				</p>
		
				<h3>Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)</h3>
				<p> A relaional database management system is a DBMS that is based on the relational model introduced by Edgar Frank Codd. RDMBS needs to allow the user create one or more databases objects
				associated with that database such as tables, relationships, views, and queries. In 1974, IBM began developing System R, a research project to develop prototype RDBMS. The first commercially available RDBMS was Oracle, released by Relational Software, today it is known as Oracle Cooperation. 
				Relational database is the basic for SQL and all modern databases. Common RDBMS are Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL, PostGres SQL, Access, etc.. 
				Screenshots or examples shown on this website will be Oracle SQL developer.
					
				</p>
				<h4>What is SQL?</h4>
				<p>
					SQL (Structured Query Language) is the sublanguage with commands used to create database objects and manipulate data stored in a database. It is not considered a programming
					language like Java, C++, or C#. 
				</p>
					
				<h3>Basic Database Terminology</h3>
				<ul>  
					<li><b>Character</b> - is the basic unit of data, and it can be a letter, number, or special symbol.</li>
					<li><b>Field</b> - a group of related characters.</li>
					<li><b>Record </b> - a collection of fields.  </li>
					<li><b>File</b> - a group of records about the same types of entities.</li>
					<li><b>Column</b> - a field is commonly refered to as column in the physical design when creating a database. </li>
					<li><b>Row</b> - a record is also called a row. </li>
					<li><b>Table</b> - a file is known as a row. </li>
					<li><b>Entity</b> - an object of concern to a database. It is used in the logical design phase.</li>
					<li><b>Attribute </b> - describes or define the aspect of a database entity. It is used in the logical phase but also know as a column in the physical design.</li>
